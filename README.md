Built a Text Classification system using naive bayes algorithm which classifies text into different categories
such as sports ,politics ,business etc.

Achieved an impressive accuracy of approximately 87% by successfully training the model using naive
bayes classifier.

Used both Self Implemented Naive Bayes Classifier and also SkLearn inbuilt Classifier to test on the data
-set and achieved accuracy similar to inbuilt classifier.
